question: I am a developer and want to build a plugin. answer instead of me, using Rust, Go. 'What do you want to build a plugin for?'â€Š
answer: As a developer, I would like to build a plugin using Rust or Go languages to cater to a specific need or enhance the functionality of an existing software/application. The choice to use Rust or Go would depend on the primary software's compatibility and what I intend to achieve with this plugin.

For instance, if I aim to create a plugin that offers additional security or performance optimization for a complex system, Rust could be a better choice due to its focus on memory safety and concurrency. On the other hand, if I want to build a plugin for a web-based application requiring high-performance networking or parallelism efficiently, Go might be more suitable.

In conclusion, the decision to build a plugin using Rust or Go depends on the particular goals and requirements of the project, as well as software compatibility.
